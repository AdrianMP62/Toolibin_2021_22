<h1>Toolibin Lake</h1>
<h1>Waterbird species richness and Guild structure; temporal variation</h1>
<p></p>
<h2>Analysis aims</h2>
<p>The fundamental aim of this report is to determine how dissimilar, and in what ways, the contemporary bird data (2017) are from historical data.</p>
<p>This analysis aims to visualise the pattern of waterbird richness at Lake Toolibin from 2017, 1996, the 1980s and historical summary data from the 1970s.</p>
<p>The 1970s data collected by Garstone is presence absence and over a perod of at least a decade upto 1975 when published by Jim Goodsell. Consequently it has very different collection effort and possibly timing from the later datasest which are more comparable, but should be useful to show a longer term picture (and pre-dating any major changes at the lake.)</p>
<p> 1980s data are all surveys from the RAOU WA_Usage database (i.e. Jaensch et al data most of which is published in the 1988 report by those authors.</p>
<p>in an earlier version of this analysis a series of deep surveys (>1.4 m) were sellected from the 1980s to match the depth of the 2017 data. It was however subsequently found that several 1980s surveys published (Froend et al 1997) as examples of the pre-salinity fauna were slightly shallower and did not fall in to the data subset. This is corrected here with a new minimum depth of >= 1.2m. Using thse five example surveys may be a better comparison with the contemporary data because they are of the same season, moderate - great depth and generally higher richness than the bulk of surveys.</p>

<p>Richness in 1975 is 18 and comparable because it is a single survey rather than the aggregate of Goodsell etal. Median is similar for other time periods at Toolibin  and distinctly higher in 1990 and 2017 at Walbyring. There is considerable variability in richness at both wetlands in the 1980s because of the larger number of surveys and the range of depth and ssalinit conditions. Would be nice to reduce the comparison to survey at similar depth. This cannot be done simply , maybe &gt 0.6m at Toolibin to include 1996. </p>
<p>There are only two surveys at toolibin (1983) that were at &lt 0.6m depth so will have to drop 1996 for comparison and up the threshold to 1.4m as recorded in Oct 2017.</p>

<p> These depth restictions reduce the comparison to 2 at Toolibin in 2017 and 34 in the 1980s, so Indices for groups are ; 1980 i=1:34, 2017 i=35:36</p>

<p>Range is still much greater in 1980s (depth still varies greatly as do other factors, hydroperiod, season, etc). median is lower in 2017 but in the inter quartile range. Now need to look at guilds, mainly to determine which ones influenced the composition differences hinted at in the NMDS. Best restrict to the same deeper surveys.</p>

<h2>Summary of guild plots for Toolibin</h2>
<p> median number of dabblers similar in 1970s,1980s, 1990s and 2017; dabblers only one species more in 1975 cumulitive list. Diver animals has  a large range in the 1980s (and probably the 1970s) and the 1996 and 2017 richness of &lt2 spp is at the bottom end of this but is not convincing of a reduced richness of this guild (check abundance to confirm lower after the 1980s). Diver veg has a median of 3 spp historically with this also the maximum. In the 90s the single species reflects seasonal conditions and matches the lower limit of the 80s, however the blue billed duck present in most of the 80 and 70s is not present in later periods. Seven species might be expected based on the 70s data but strongly dependent on water levels thaey are mostly absent from the 1980s when its too deep and only 1 or 2 spp elsewhen.Large waders represented by 5 species in the 70s and 80s with thisis also the max/survey in the 80s. Only 2 of the species present during 2017 and the rufous night heron, present in 70% of earlier surveys (up to 1984) has not been recorded in 1996 or 2017. while 6 species were recorded during the 1970s the shorefeeder-animal guild was only present at shallower depths (not in this analysis) during the 80s , only the SN ibis was present above1.4 m deep and then only in 2017.   Shorefeeder veg was only ever a small guild (3spp in 70s) and while survey median is higher in 2017 it is within the range observed in the 80s.Purple swamphen the only memeber no recorded in 2017 and it was only recorded once in the 80s. Aerial guild has only 2 members; the whiskered tern was not sighted at the depths analysed and the swamp harrier was only recorded in 20% of 80s surveys and once in 2107; too few sightings to make anything of.</p> 
<p> dabblers total 9, diver animals 9 but only 7 recorded at analysed depths, same for diver veg where 4 have been recorded but only 3 at the analysed depths, small waders number 11 overall but only 8 recorded at these depths,RKDot the  one not recorded in 1975.this guild only includes the 5 spp recorded in the 70s and all were present at this analysis depth.shorefeeder-animal represented by 6 but only one present at the analysed depths, shorefeeder-veg includes only the 3spp found in 70s,aerial has only 1 member at this depth.</p>
<p> Overall there is minimal change in the values for each guild in the >1.2m vs >1.4 m datasets. what are the guild richnesses for just the pre-salinity example surveys?? The example surveys are TR1081,TR03D82,TR0982,TR0983,TR0984 and in "guilds" their indices are c(1,10,18,23,32) add c(35:38) and we can compare this example set with the 1970s and contemporary data.</p>
<!--begin.rcode

examples<-c(1,10,18,23,32,35:38)
boxplot(Sdab~PP,R[examples,], main="pre-salinity dabblers")#just plot richness of pre-salinity examples & the 75,96 and 2017 data

boxplot(Sae~PP,R[examples,], main="pre-salinity aerial")
R[examples,]
end.rcode-->

<p>using this subsetting of the data we again see the cline in richness of diver animals exaggerated as some of the disperion is reduced across the fewer surveys. The cline in  large waders is similarly pronounced. Dabblers remain pretty constant as do the least rich guilds. So depending on the subsetting of the data the strngth of the cline in 2 guilds is altered, that's fine but we need the median values to report for the different levels of subsetting (See appendices).</p>

<h2>Subsetting guild data by total richness</h2>
<p>While writing up I find I can't really justify the subsetting by depth; it should leave the 70s and 1996 data out. In the figure for total richness in the 1980s we can see that 75% of all surveys are &gt 10 spp. I believe the 25% below this level unduly depress the median richness of guilds so re-try subsetting with this &gt 9spp criterion</p>

<p>At Walbyring there seems to be an increase (1.5 sp) in the median richness of dabblers, and divers-animal and diver veg increase by 1 and 2 spp respectively but remain within the 1980s range.  These are pretty small changes in richness. There are no patterns amongst diver animal or large waders to match those in Toolibin; richness in these guilds always pretty low at Walbyring.</p>
<h2>Recovery Plan Indicator species</h2>
<p>There are 6 species that the recovery plan aims to maintain at abundances "comparable to those from previous surveys". So, now plot abundance for each time period for these 6 species as both raw abundance and standardised (a proportion of) total abundance in the surveys. I think this standardisation may be necessary to control for good and bad years.</p>
<p> This analysis using all surveys

<p> Certainly not a pretty picture but raw abundance is within previously observed ranges during 2017 at both wetlands. Abundance during 1990s was higher than median for 80s or 2017. Freckled duck in 2017 have abundance 1 and so are at the low end of observed abundances, this is also true for shelduck and to an extent coot where as grey teal and pink-eared duck are present at greater than median abundance of the 1980s</p>
<p>To clarify this analysis of abundance we should eliminate the confusion caused by different total abundances irrespective of species in different years. This requires standardising species abundances by dividing with the total abundance of the survey and can be done as command "total" in decostand </p>

<p> Ok this standardisation is not preferred simply because it can't be compared with the management goals which are described in terms of raw abundance.</p>
